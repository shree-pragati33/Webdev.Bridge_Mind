            <h2>BridgeMind is an adaptable set of open solutions specially developed to support learning for the half of the world without Internet access. Centered around an offline-first learning platform that runs on a variety of low-cost and legacy devices, the BridgeMind Product Ecosystem includes a curricular tool, a library of open educational resources, and a toolkit of resources to support training and implementation in formal, informal, and non-formal learning environments.</h2>
            <h3>BridgeMind is aiming to serve millions of learners and educators living in underserved contexts where the internet is costly, unreliable, or simply beyond reach.</h3>

            <h2>THE BRIDGEMIND LEARNING PLATFORM - AN OVERVIEW</h2>
            <h3>1. "Seeding" a Device</h3>
            <p>BridgeMind installers, updates, and content can be downloaded once to a device in an area that has an internet connection</p>
            <h3>RUNS ON ANYTHING</h3>
            <p>To facilitate broad, low-cost adoption, the BridgeMind Learning Platform is designed to run on as many devices and operating systems as possible, leveraging existing legacy hardware or low-cost off-the-shelf devices. This includes Windows, Linux, and macOS. We're also building the BridgeMind Learning Platform to run standalone as an Android app.</p>
            <h3>SUPPORTS SELF-PACED LEARNING</h3>
            <p>Track and analyze growth for individuals and groups of learners accurately and easily, even in informal educational contexts. The BridgeMind Learning Platform comes with tools such as a coach board, creation, exercise, agent of content for differentiated instruction, and a recommendation tool that displays and relates based on a learner's history, progress, and goal.</p>

            <h3>ENABLES SYNCING AND SHARING</h3>
            <p>Devices running the BridgeMind Learning Platform can sync and share content and data over a local M-R network, allowing for easy content sharing and data syncing.</p>

            <h2>HOW DOES BRIDGEMIND REACH THE DISCONNECTED?</h2>
            <h3>2. Peer-to-Peer Distribution</h3>
            <p>That "seeded" device can then share new content and updates with other devices over an offline network, allowing for easy content sharing and data syncing.</p>
            <h3>3. Last Mile via "Sneakernet"</h3>
            <p>To reach the most remote communities, a device can be carried by foot to share installers, updates, and content with other devices over local networks.</p>

        <section id="bridgemind-content-library">
            <h2>THE BRIDGEMIND CONTENT LIBRARY</h2>
            <p>We've collected open or appropriately licensed resources from around the world for our BridgeMind Content Library, where you can find over 80 educational collections of games, books, simulations, assessments, and more, from educational organizations and creators.</p>
            <p>Everything in the Library is ready for you to use as-is on BridgeMind - but in order to get the most out of these materials, you are also invited to reorganize them: align them to your curriculum standards, select only specific sections, and/or pre-organize them for your learners and educators.</p>
